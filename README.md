Practicing DOM manipulation.

Overview:
-Practiced adding elements to the DOM through JavaScript.
-Wrote reusable functions (though not sure how useful they are).
-First time using CSS Grid and editing CSS from .js file (setting the number of columns and rows depending on user input).
-I don't like the random colours, but left it as it was the first time doing anything like that.
