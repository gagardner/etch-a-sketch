## Etch-a-Sketch

**Browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch.**

**Aims:**
Practicing DOM manipulation.

**Outcomes:**
- Practiced adding elements to the DOM through JavaScript
- Wrote reusable functions (though not sure how useful they are)
- First time using CSS Grid and editing CSS from .js file (setting the number of columns and rows depending on user input)
- I don't like the random colours, but left it as it was the first time doing anything like that
